# REACT REDUX TOOLKIT COUNTER

Practice on the use of the Redux Toolkit. Redux Toolkit includes a set of tools for efficient Redux development. It includes utilities to simplify common use cases such as store setup, reducer creation, immutable update logic, and more.

## Project description

In this project we will again build a counter that we can contrast and compare with the one we previously built using only Redux, here is the link to the repository: https://github.com/newmanferrer/react-redux-counter.git.

I also leave a link to another of my projects where I only use Redux, I hope to be able to upload it using the Redux Toolkit soon: https://github.com/newmanferrer/react-redux-shopping-cart.git

This will allow us to decide if it is better for us to manage our states with Redux or using a tool like Redux Toolkit.

The structure of folders and file names are very important to me since they allow me to understand and locate components, hooks, services, etc. faster, I think this takes a lot of time but it helps me. I hope that this structure can be understood and if you have suggestions they will be well received since I do not have much experience.

Our application itself, as I already mentioned, will be very simple, it will allow us to increase, decrease and return our counter to its initial state.

The most important and relevant part of this practice is the management of our global states using the Redux Toolkit.
